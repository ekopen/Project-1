This project analyzes NYC Airbnb listings from March 2025.
I cleaned the data in Python, stored it in a SQLite database, and used SQL to explore pricing trends.
Visualizations were built in Seaborn to show insights by borough, review score, and superhost status.
The goal was to practice end-to-end data analysis with real-world data.
